# matconvnet-transferlearning
use matconvnet construct a vgg16 transferlearning 
the project use imagenet-vgg-verydeeep-16.mat as pretrained model,and modify the last classifier-layer nodes from 1000 to 3(my data include 3 class),you can run cnn_transferlearning.m,after top1error decease to zero ,interrupt it. you trained model will save in 'model_transferlearning' file,then you can run test_transferlearning.m to extraction and canculate the accuracy of test sets
due to the imgae and trained model is so big.so I upload it to my baidu cloud ,every could download and use it for free, beflow
